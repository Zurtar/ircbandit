# ircbandit
Simple program using IRC to provide users with textbooks and other books.

It's meant to interact with popular ebook IRC channels like Undernets #bookz and be an interface for the many server bots there.

Fairly dead project, but I would like to come back to it at some point, as I do believe it has potential.
